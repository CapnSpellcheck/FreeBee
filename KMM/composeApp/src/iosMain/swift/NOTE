These Swift files were compiled into static libraries with swift-klib-plugin. I was using a pre-release version
for a new feature, so I inserted the output of that - Kotlin interop files - into this repo and
turned off the plugin for now. So, editing the swift files here will not result in anything, unless you rebuild the
static lib.

Example commands to produce a static Swift lib:
(note: first make a staging directory, put the Package.swift there and put the source e.g. KannaObjc.swift into KannaWrapper)
iosSimulatorArm64: xcrun swift build -c release -Xswiftc -target -Xswiftc arm64-apple-ios15.6-simulator  --sdk /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator17.2.sdk -Xcc -isysroot -Xcc /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator17.2.sdk
iosArm64: xcrun swift build -c release -Xswiftc -target -Xswiftc arm64-apple-ios15.6  --sdk /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS17.2.sdk -Xcc -isysroot -Xcc /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS17.2.sdk
iosX64: xcrun swift build -c release -Xswiftc -target -Xswiftc x86_64-apple-ios15.6-simulator --sdk /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator17.2.sdk -Xcc -isysroot -Xcc /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator17.2.sdk

DO NOT USE --triple LIKE swiftklib PLUGIN!

In the module.modulemap, change the header reference path to be "./"
